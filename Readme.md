# Machine Learning Projects

This repository - currently being populated - houses some of my machine learning projects. I also use machine learning in many of my publications such as https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-019-01235-z (can't get behind paywall? use: https://psyarxiv.com/arf4t)

## Kinds of Mobile Strategy Games

There are more than a hundred thousand strategy games on the app store, more than any human can understand and summarize. A game developer may want to know about the kinds of games available to inform game design, marketing, and pricing. I find that there are 8 main kinds of strategy games on the app store. I find this using:

* Word embeddings
* Dimensionality reduction (using a new neural network-based technique: Ivis) 
* Clustering (kmeans++)
